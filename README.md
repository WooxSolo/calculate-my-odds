Work in progress.

# TODO-list

- Add support for partial completion goals.
- Add support for conditional rolls on tables.
- Add more options for the goals (e.g. conditions based on iterations).
- Write a bunch of tests for the calculator and simulator.
- Make the UI more intuitive (add header, add instructions, fix inconsistent wording, etc).
- Consider optimizing the speed of the calculator and simulator.
- Go through all the TODOs in the code.
- Maybe some more stuff I've forgotten.

Other considerations for the future:

- Add templates for common use cases.
- Add options to easily save and/or share a set of tables and goals.
- Add an option to show the non-cumulative success rate in the results.
- Add option for higher precision results for the calculator.
- Add more options for memorizing rolls (e.g. keep only last roll to simulate dices).
- Allow more complex expressions as input for goal and roll conditions (e.g. arithmetic, count the most commonly rolled item).
- Allow user to write scripts for cases which the calculator does not handle. However preferably the calculator should handle as much as possible on its own.
